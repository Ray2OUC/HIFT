# Learning Enriched Feature Descriptor for Image Matching and Visual Measurement
demo and pre-trained weight of HIFT --- a dense descriptor for local feature matching.

Our work was accepted by IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation & Measurement 2023, and can be accessed via [manuscript](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10058693).
# Pre-Trained Weights
We trained our HIFT with one-stage end-to-end triplet training strategy on MS-COCO, Multi-illumination and VIDIT datasets (same as LISRD) and the pre-trained weight is available at [hift](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uOLlh--rT6_UY5VmA7-oFypCemoQJ527/view?usp=sharing)

# Model file
The core implementation of HIFT is shown in HIFT_core.py

# DEMOï¼šSIFT+HIFT
1. We provide the image matching demo of using SIFT keypoints and HIFT descriptor in demo.ipynb.
2. We provide the demo of exporting SIFT keypoints and HIFT descriptor in export_descriptor_sift.py, and it can be easily modified to other off-the-shelf detectors and matchers for evaluation. 
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python export_descriptor_sift.py
```
